        <p> Only invited users who have been granted the corresponding qualification can participate. You will be given another chance to go through the full game and experiment description. But you may choose to skip it and head for the waiting room immediately. The experiment will start at 1:05 PM CT. If you reach the lobby after 1:05 PM CT you will not be able to take part in the experiment. The experiment will consist of a sequence of 5 practice 60-second games for which you will not receive any bonus reward, followed by a sequence of 54 60-second regular games. For each of the regular games you will receive a base payment of $0.15. In addition, for each game in which the objective is reached you will earn a bonus between $0.10 and $0.40 (incentives will be varied). Estimated completion time is 1 hour and 10 minutes.</p>

    <p> IMPORTANT: No more than 20 users can play a game simultaneously. Thus, if more than 20 people show up on time, we will rotate participation so that you will not have to pause for more than one batch at a time. Since this experiment consists of 1-game batches, this means that you will not need to wait for more than 70 seconds (but sometimes even less) until the next game in which you will have the chance to play. You will still receive the base payment of $0.15, even for games that you are not participating in. </p>

    <p> IMPORTANT: Please do not work on other tasks while participating in the experiment. Being able to quickly respond to color changes and messages of other participants greatly increases the chances for reaching a consensus. In case a participant does not make at least one color choice in more than 1 game, they will be kicked out of the experiment, as such a behavior prevents the reaching of a consensus regardless of what the other players do. </p>
